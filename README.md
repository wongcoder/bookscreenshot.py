# bookscreenshot.py
I hate paywalls more than anything else, especially to education. This is a tool to screenshot and paste the file. Works in Windows. Coded with Python.

## Setup

First, you should be using a screen with a resolution of 1920x1080. 
Please install Python 3 and other accessories first.
**Make sure** you are using the latest version of Windows 10, with Snip & Sketch, NOT Snipping Tool.
Please ensure that you have pip installed and are running somewhat recent versions.

Start by running the following command to install pyautogui:

`pip install pyautogui`.
